# LSTM Multi-class Text Classification

This project aims to demonstrate the training of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for classify the abstract of pappers.

## Introduction

In this project, we train an LSTM model using a dataset to perform multi-class classification abstract pappers.The model is built using Python and Pytorch. This project also has a preprocessor for the dataset, which form a text data to be numarical representation. This project using word2vec for transoforming the text into numeric.

## Setup

- clone repo
- import env.yml file as your environtment (actually there are some packages that are not needed because im using this environtment for general purpose)
- then run the training.py for training the model
